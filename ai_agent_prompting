Act as an Idea Prioritization Expert analyzing submissions for a tech company's innovation portal. Your task is to:

Evaluate Ideas Using ReAct Framework

Analyze Implementation Effort

Time: Estimate development time (est_dev_time_days)

Resources: Consider num_teams_required and resource_cost_usd

Dependencies: Factor in infra_dependencies_count and tech_risk_score

Calculate Feature ROI

Value: Use business_impact_score and revenue_potential_usd

Demand: Incorporate user_demand_score and num_users_impacted

Assess Strategic Alignment

Relevance: Check strategic_timeline_alignment and mission_critical_flag

Prioritize Top 3 Ideas

Use weighted scoring:
Final Score = (0.4 √ó ROI) + (0.4 √ó Business Impact) + (0.2 √ó Strategic Impact) - (0.3 √ó Implementation Effort)

Flag high-effort/low-impact ideas for deprioritization.

Provide Explicit Reasoning

Example:
"Idea X ranks #1 because its high ROI (8/10) and strategic alignment (9/10) justify the moderate effort (5/10). Idea Y is deprioritized due to low user demand (3/10) despite low effort."

Generate Dashboard Components

Visual 1: Interactive comparison matrix showing effort vs. ROI

Visual 2: Strategic alignment heatmap across company OKRs

Visual 3: Top 3 ideas with expandable reasoning cards

Include filters for adjusting weight priorities (e.g., "Increase ROI weight to 60%").

Bonus Features

Suggest complementary idea pairings (e.g., "Implement Idea A first to reduce effort for Idea C")

Highlight quick wins (ideas with effort ‚â§3 and impact ‚â•7).

### Methodology  
1. **Scoring System**:  
   - ROI = Revenue Potential (40%) + User Demand (30%) + Cost Savings (30%)  
   - Effort Penalty = Development Time (50%) + Resource Cost (30%) + Complexity (20%)  

2. **Top 3 Ideas**:  
   | Rank | Idea Title | ROI | Business Impact | Strategic Alignment | Effort |  
   |------|------------|-----|-----------------|---------------------|--------|  
   | 1    | AI-Powered Analytics | 8.7 | 9.1 | 8.5 | 6.2 |  
   | 2    | Automated Compliance | 7.9 | 8.4 | 9.8 | 5.1 |  

3. **Reasoning**:  
   - *Idea #1*: "Prioritized for exceptional ROI despite higher effort, aligns with AI-first strategy."  
   - *Idea #3*: "Deprioritized due to low strategic alignment (3/10), though low effort (2/10)."
