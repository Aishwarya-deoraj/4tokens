# InnovAIte: Idea Portal AI Agent with React Framework  
**[View the Tool!](https://fourtokens.onrender.com)**

## ðŸ“Œ Project Overview  
**InnovAIte** is an advanced platform designed to streamline the process of innovation by empowering users to submit ideas and have them prioritized using artificial intelligence. The platform utilizes an **AI agent powered by the ReAct (Reasoning-Action) framework** to evaluate ideas based on **Business Impact**, **Return on Investment (ROI)**, and **Strategic Alignment**.  

With a user-friendly frontend and a powerful backend, InnovAIte helps businesses **maximize the value of customer-driven innovation** while offering clear insights and tracking the development process through a **PowerBI Analytics Dashboard**.

## ðŸŽ¯ Objective  
InnovAIte is designed to **facilitate crowdsourced innovation**, allowing businesses to **collect, assess, and prioritize customer ideas**. By leveraging AI, the platform identifies the most impactful ideas based on multiple business metrics, ensuring the development team can focus on **high-priority projects** that offer substantial ROI and align with strategic goals.

## âœ¨ Key Features

- **ðŸ§  AI Agent with ReAct Framework**  
  Powered by the **ReAct (Reasoning + Action)** framework, the AI agent evaluates ideas, identifies high-value concepts, and recommends the **top 3 ideas** for prioritization using machine learning models.

- **ðŸ“Š Model Scores for Prioritization**  
  Each idea is **scored and ranked** based on three key business metrics:
  - **Business Impact**
  - **Return on Investment (ROI)**
  - **Strategic Alignment**  
  These scores offer transparency and help users understand the **rationale behind prioritization**.

- **ðŸ’¡ Detailed Idea Interface with Thought Chains**  
  The platform presents prioritized ideas along with the **chain of reasoning** used by the AI agent. This provides clarity and supports informed decision-making by the development team.

- **ðŸ“ˆ InnovAIte Analytics Dashboard**  
  A comprehensive **PowerBI dashboard** that tracks the **real-world performance** of implemented ideas. Users can analyze the impact on various business metrics and decide **which metric to optimize next**.


## Repo Structure

## Usage

- **Explore Ideas**: Navigate to the "Priority" tab to view the top 3 ideas recommended by the AI agent.
- **View Prioritized Ideas**: Navigate to the "Priority" tab to view the top 3 ideas recommended by the AI agent.
- **Customize Prioritization**: Adjust the weights of Business Impact, ROI, and Strategic Alignment to see how the prioritized ideas change based on your inputs.
- **Review Analytics**: Explore the PowerBI analytics dashboard to track how the prioritized ideas have impacted the business over time and adjust strategies accordingly.


## Datasets
### Ideas Dataset
This dataset captures all ideas submitted through the platform. Each entry contains the following information:

The dataset consists of structured information about ideas submitted by users. It is organized into high-level categories capturing metadata, business impact, financial viability, and strategic relevance.

### ðŸ“Œ Idea Details
- `ID`: Unique identifier for the idea  
- `Description`: Textual summary of the idea  
- `Upvotes`: Number of user endorsements  
- `Comments`: Number of user comments  
- `Submission Date`: Date the idea was submitted  
- `Status`: Current status of the idea (e.g., proposed, in progress, implemented)

### ðŸ“Š Business Impact
- `est_dev_time_days`: Estimated development time (in days)  
- `complexity_score`: Complexity of implementation  
- `num_teams_required`: Number of teams needed for development  
- `resource_cost_usd`: Estimated resource cost in USD  
- `infra_dependencies_count`: Number of infrastructure dependencies  
- `tech_risk_score`: Technical risk associated with implementation  
- `design_effort_days`: Estimated design effort in days  
- `qa_effort_days`: Estimated quality assurance effort in days  
- `deployment_complexity`: Complexity of deploying the solution  
- `integration_needed`: Indicates if integration with other systems is required

### ðŸ’° Return on Investment (ROI)
- `business_impact_score`: Estimated impact on business  
- `user_demand_score`: Score based on user demand  
- `customer_satisfaction_impact`: Impact on customer satisfaction  
- `time_saved_per_user_minutes`: Minutes saved per user per use  
- `num_users_impacted`: Number of users affected by the feature  
- `market_differentiation_score`: Score reflecting uniqueness in the market  
- `revenue_potential_usd`: Estimated revenue potential  
- `cost_savings_usd`: Estimated cost savings  
- `scalability_potential_score`: Score estimating how scalable the idea is  
- `feature_adoption_likelihood`: Likelihood of user adoption of the feature

### ðŸ§­ Strategic Alignment
- `aligns_with_okrs`: Indicates if the idea aligns with key OKRs  
- `supports_key_initiative`: Whether it supports a strategic initiative  
- `compliance_or_regulatory_benefit`: Benefit in terms of compliance or regulation  
- `innovation_score`: Score indicating the level of innovation
